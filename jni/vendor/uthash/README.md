# uthash

This folder contains Android build configuration for [uthash](http://troydhanson.github.io/uthash/). While the library is header-only and as such doesn't even need build configuration, I find it easier to have the source code included as a Git submodule and using LOCAL_STATIC_LIBRARIES to load it.
